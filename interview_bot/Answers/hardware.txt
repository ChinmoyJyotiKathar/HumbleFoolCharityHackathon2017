The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).  It has all the trappings of a computer, with a dedicated memory, processor, and a graphics card for output through HDMI. 
The Raspberry Pi has a full operating system, video output, USB ports, networking and audio output built in. However because the Arduino doesnâ€™t have an operating system, it can respond to the real world more quickly and efficiently.
