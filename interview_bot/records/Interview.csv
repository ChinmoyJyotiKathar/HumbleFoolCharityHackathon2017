"What is difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
",supervised learning reqires labelled data unsupervised does not require labelled data,"Supervised learning is one of the methods associated with machine learning which involves allocating labeled data so that a certain pattern or function can be deduced from that data. Unsupervised learning is the second method of machine learning algorithm where inferences are drawn from unlabeled input data.

"What is training set and test set?
",training set is set used to train the parameters of a model while test set is used to evaluate the model,"Training set is a set of examples used for learning, that is to fit the parameters. Test set is the set of examples used only to assess the performance

"What is a normal distribution?
",normal distribution is like climbing the himalayas,"Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

"What is difference between front end and back end programming?
",front end means UI design and back end means the server code,"Frontend is the part of the website that you can see and interact with directly in order to receive the backend capabilities of the system. It involves everything that the user can see, touch and experience.Backend, also referred to as the “server-side”, is the part of the website which you cannot see and interact with. Basically, everything that happens behind the scenes can be attributed to the backend web development.
